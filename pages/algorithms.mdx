## Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)

### Overview

**Shamir's Secret Sharing** is an algorithm in cryptography created by Adi Shamir. It is a form of _secret sharing_, where a **Secret** is divided into **Shares**, giving each participant its own unique **Share**. To reconstruct the original **Secret**, a minimum number of **Shares** is required. In the threshold scheme, the **Secret** is divided into $n$ **Shares** and at least $k$ **Shares** are required to reconstruct the orignial **Secret**.

Even though a lot of services and systems nowadays are using **SSS** to protect the user's **Private Key**, but **SSS** is safe only when the generation of keys are done in one environment without any communication between the participants. That's why we only apply it at the client to divide the user's **Private Key** into **Factors**.

When it comes to servers where everything is vulnerable, or a distributed network where the node operators are anonymous, there is no way to apply any cryptographic technique on **SSS** to protect the **Secrets**.

### Our implementation

In our application, we have 3 **Factors** which are **Network Factor**, **Device Factor** and **Recovery Factor**. Also on this _Cartesian coordinate system_, we can generate as many **Child Keys** as needed by choosing the x-value randomly and calculate the corresponding y-value.

But since all of those **Keys** following a single polynomial, if user cannot reconstruct this straight line, everything will be lost.

## Distributed Secret Sharing (DSS)

### Overview

The predecessor of this algorithm is from **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** process from **Torus Labs**. The **DSS** algorithm is a advanced version of **SSS** in which it is safe to generate the keys in a distributed environment without having to share the **Secrets** between the participants.

### Our implementation

In our application, we use 5 nodes whose the polynomial is of degree 2. In future, we also plan to increase the number of nodes to 9 in future (which means the degree of the polynomial is 3). But to make it simple, the following example is for the 3-node system.

In which, $\Sigma\text{z}_{*}$ is the **Network Key** (or called as **Master Secret** in the algorithm context), it can be calculated by the sum of **Secrets** $\text{s}_{*}$ from the nodes. But instead, we apply an **SSS** for each node to divide its **Secret** into **Shares** and deliver each of them corresponding to each of the other nodes.

When all the nodes complete the sharing process, each of them can construct its **Master Share** by calculate the sum of the **Shares** it recevied and transfer it to the client. The process is of course masked by an encryption layer.

The client after receiving all the **Master Shares** from the nodes, it can calculate the **Network Key** by applying _Lagrange interpolation_ to 2/3 of the **Master Shares** to construct the **Master Share's Polynomial** and intersect it with the y-axis.

<Note>
    In short, the **DSS** algorithm is a set of **SSS** algorithms corresponding
    to each of the nodes in the network.

### Proof

Considering node 1, we can see that $\left(1, s_1^1\right)$, $\left(2, s_1^2\right)$ and $\left(3, s_1^3\right)$ are the points on the polynomial $f_1(x) = z_1 + \alpha_1x$. Therefore, we have a system of linear equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
z_1 + \alpha_1 = s_1^1 \\
z_1 + 2\alpha_1 = s_1^2 \\
z_1 + 3\alpha_1 = s_1^3
\end{cases}
$$

We can represent this for any $i$-th node by transforming it into a matrix equation as $\textbf{A} \times \textbf{z}_i = \textbf{s}_i$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 2 \\
1 & 3
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
z_i \\
\alpha_i
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
s_i^1 \\
s_i^2 \\
s_i^3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Similarly, we also have $\textbf{A} \times \Sigma\textbf{z}_* = \Sigma\textbf{s}_*$ since $\left(1, \Sigma s_*^1\right)$, $\left(2, \Sigma s_*^2\right)$ and $\left(3, \Sigma s_*^3\right)$ are the points on the polynomial $f_*(x) = \Sigma z_* + \Sigma\alpha_*x$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 2 \\
1 & 3
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\Sigma z_* \\
\Sigma \alpha_*
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\Sigma s_*^1 \\
\Sigma s_*^2 \\
\Sigma s_*^3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Since we have $\textbf{z}_* = \begin{bmatrix} \textbf{A} \mid \textbf{s}_* \end{bmatrix}$ are already non-singlar matrices. Therefore, $\Sigma \textbf{z}_* = \Sigma{\begin{bmatrix} \textbf{A} \mid \textbf{s}_* \end{bmatrix}} = \begin{bmatrix} n \times \textbf{A} \mid \Sigma\textbf{s}_* \end{bmatrix}$ is also non-singular (from _positive-definiteness property_).

Thus, the row-echelon form $\Sigma\textbf{z}_* = \begin{bmatrix} \textbf{A} \mid \Sigma\textbf{s}_* \end{bmatrix}$ is a non-singular matrix (from _consistency of the augmented matrix property_), which leads the system of linear equations $\textbf{A} \times \Sigma\textbf{z}_* = \Sigma\textbf{s}_*$ to have a unique solution, or $\Sigma z_*$ is valid and unique. We call it **Master Secret**.

The same proof can be also applied for polynomials of any degree $n$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
1 & 2 & 4 & \cdots & 2^{n-1} \\
1 & 3 & 9 & \cdots & 3^{n-1} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & n & n^2 & \cdots & n^{n-1}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
z_i \\
\alpha_i \\
\alpha_i^2 \\
\vdots \\
\alpha_i^{n-1}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
s_i^1 \\
s_i^2 \\
s_i^3 \\
\vdots \\
s_i^n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Interchangeable Secret Sharing (ISS)

### Overview

Regarding to the **DSS** algorithm above, we can see that 3/3 nodes are needed to generate the **Network Key** and 2/3 nodes are needed to derive the **Key**. Therefore, if one of the nodes is down, the system will be unavailable for users to register (but still available for the existing users to login).

### Our implementation

To solve this problem, we apply a mechanism that a node will supervise another node circularly and be responsible to simulate that node's behavior (e.g creating **Secret** and delivering **Shares** on its behalf) when that node is down.

But in the 3-node system, this is completely dangerous because in this case, one node can control 2/3 of the network, which is enough to manipulate the user's **Master Key**. Luckily, our system implements 5 nodes, which can prevent this vulnerability. But we only accept this mechanism when JUST ONE node is down, if there are 2 nodes, there are two cases:

-   _The second down node is the one that is supervised by the first down node_: There is not enough nodes.
-   _The second down node is not the one that is supervised by the first down node_: The system is vulnerable because there are 2 nodes controlling 2/5 of the network.

That's why, in the 5-node system, 4/5 nodes are needed to generate the **Network Key** and 3/5 nodes are needed to derive the **Network Key**.

## Recoverable Secret Sharing (RSS)

### Overview

After having applied the **ISS** algorithm to ensure the system's availability, we must recover the data generated by its supervising node. Of course we will not allow the supervising node to save that data and deliver directly to that node. Instead, we will apply a algorithm that allows the other nodes to consensually recover the data by sharing the **Shares** they generated for that node.

## Proactive Secret Sharing (PSS)

### Overview

In a distributed and trustless network, there is no way to ensure that a node will keep the data safe and private after a node joins and leaves the network. That's why we apply a mechanism that allows the nodes to proactively update their **Shares** and **Master Shares** whenever a node leaves the network.

## Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)

### Overview

In addition to the vulnerabilities for a distributed key management system that we mentioned above, there is a problem that the nodes can generate fake **Shares** and **Master Shares** to falsify the system and **Keys**. To solve this problem, we apply a **Zero-Knowledge** mechanism to prove that the **Shares** that a node delivered are valid without forcing it to reveal its **Secret**.

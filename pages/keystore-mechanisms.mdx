## Theorem 1 - Client Key & Factor definition

When a user registers an account by logging in Arism Wallet with a third-party provider (eg. Google) for the first time, the wallet application (client) will generate randomly a **Client Key**.

$$
\text{key}_\text{client} \overset{{\scriptscriptstyle{\text{R}}}}{\leftarrow}\mathbb{G} | \text{client}
$$

This is also considered as the Private Key for user.

$$
pk = \text{key}_\text{client}
$$

**Client Factor** is the point located on the y-axis in the _Cartesian coordinate system_ with the height is **Client Key** value.

$$
\textbf{Factor}_\text{client} = (0, \text{key}_\text{client})
$$

## Theorem 2 - Distributed Secret Sharing (DSS)

Then the **Arism Network** will execute a bunch of advanced algorithms to take care of creating a **Network Key**. This is called **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** step.

<Plot func="x^2" xDomain={[-10, 10]} yDomain={[-10, 10]} />

## Theorem 3 - Network Key & Factor definition

**Network Key** is the result of **DKG** process on the **Arism Network**.

$$
\text{key}_\text{network} \leftarrow \text{DKG} | \text{network}
$$

Combine it with $x = 1$, we have **Network Factor** as a point in the _Cartesian coordinate system_, which is represented as below.

$$
\textbf{Factor}_\text{network} = (1, \text{key}_\text{network})
$$

## Theorem 4 - Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)

With those two points, we can establish a unique line (i.e a first degree equation) on the _Cartesian coordinate system_ using _Lagrange interpolation_. This is called **Factor's Polynomial**.

The process of creating the **Factor's Polynomial** is called **Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)**.

$$
\textbf{P} \leftarrow \text{SSS}|\text{client}
$$

## Theorem 5 - Device Key & Factor definition

Once having the **Factor's Polynomial**, we will get a third key called **Device Key** by retrieving the value of the polynomial where $x = 2$. This **Key** is stored in user's device (browser)

$$
\text{key}_\text{device} = \textbf{P}(x = 2)
$$

This pair of values will form a point we will call the **Device Factor**.

$$
\textbf{Factor}_\text{device} = (2, \text{key}_\text{device})
$$

## Theorem 6 - Private Key derivation technique

Therefore, every time user logs in later, it's just needed to log in on the original device (to get the **Device Key**) with the registered third-party account (to get the **Network Key**).

Then user can recreate the **Factor's Polynomial** by using _Lagrange interpolation_, and get the **Private Key** by intersecting it with the y-axis (where $x = 0$).

$$
pk = \textbf{P}(x = 0)
$$

## Theorem 7 - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

User can optionally turn on the **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** feature, this is a recommended feature because if it is turned on, user will be able to log in on a new device, just need the correct password.

## Theorem 8 - Recovery Key & Factor definition

Therefore, there is an additional **Key** which is basically the password.

$$
\text{key}_\text{recovery} = \textbf{H}(\text{password}) \\
$$

This is called **Recovery Key**, but in order to make a point for **Recovery Factor**, its x-value on the _Cartesian coordinate system_ is needed. We will restore the **Factor's Polynomial** by using **Lagrange interpolation** for the **Private Key** and the **Device Key**.

Then, the x-value will then be the value that when substituted it into the **Factor's Polynomial**, the result will be the **Recovery Key**.

$$
\textbf{Factor}_\text{recovery} = \left(\textbf{P}^{-1}(\text{key}_\text{recovery}), \text{key}_\text{recovery}\right)
$$

The x-value $\textbf{P}^{-1}(\text{key}_\text{recovery})$ will be stored in to the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** for the purpose of combining with the user's password to recreate the **Recovery Factor** when needed. Obviously this doesn't need security because only this x-value alone can't manipulate anything.

## Theorem 9 - Private Key derivation threshold

Overall, whenever user logs in, there is only 2/3 **Factors** needed to be provided: **Network Factor**, **Device Factor** and **Recovery Factor** (if **MFA** is turned on).

## Theorem 10 - Multi-key generation

With the same idea, user can generate as many keys as they want. When generating a new key, the **Client Key** will be generated randomly again, and the **Network Key** will be generated by the **Arism Network** again. Then the **Device Key** will be generated by the **Factor's Polynomial** again.

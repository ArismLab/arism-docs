# Keystore Mechanisms

## Theorem 1 - Private Factor definition

When a user registers an account by logging in Arism Wallet with a third-party provider (eg. Google) though OAuth for the first time, the wallet application (client) will generate randomly a **Private Key** $\sigma_\text{priv}$ for the user.

$$
\sigma_\text{priv} \overset{{\scriptscriptstyle{\text{R}}}}{\leftarrow}\mathbb{G}  \mid  \text{client}
$$

User can also provide their existed **Private Key** to the client for preventing this random generation process.

**Private Factor** $\Phi_\text{priv}$ is the point located on the y-axis in the _Cartesian coordinate system_ whose the height is **Private Key** value.

$$
\Phi_\text{priv} = (0, \sigma_\text{priv})
$$

## Theorem 2 - Network Factor definition

Then the **Mainnet** will execute **Distributed Secret Sharing (DSS)** to take care of creating a **Network Key** $\sigma_\text{net}$ for the user which determined by the user's *OAuth Token*.

$$
\sigma_\text{net} \leftarrow \text{DSS(\texttt{oauth\_token})}  \mid  \text{network}
$$

Combine it with $x = 1$, we have **Network Factor** $\Phi_\text{net}$ as a point in the _Cartesian coordinate system_, which is represented as below.

$$
\Phi_\text{net} = (1, \sigma_\text{net})
$$

## Theorem 3 - Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)

With those two points, we can establish a unique straight line (i.e a first degree equation) on the _Cartesian coordinate system_ using _Lagrange interpolation_. This is called **Factor's Polynomial** $f_\Phi$.

The process of creating the **Factor's Polynomial** is called **Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)**.

$$
f_\Phi \leftarrow \text{SSS}(\Phi_\text{priv}, \Phi_\text{net}) \mid \text{client}
$$

## Theorem 4 - Device Factor definition

Once having the **Factor's Polynomial**, we will get a third key called **Device Key** by retrieving the value of the polynomial where $x = 2$. This **Key** is stored in user's device (browser)

$$
\sigma_\text{dev} \leftarrow f_\Phi(x = 2) \mid \text{client}
$$

This pair of values will form a point we will call the **Device Factor**.

$$
\Phi_\text{dev} = (2, \sigma_\text{dev})
$$

## Theorem 5 - Recovery Factor definition

User can optionally turn on the **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** feature, this is a recommended feature because if it is turned on, user will be able to log in on a new device, just need the correct password.

Therefore, there is an additional **Key** which is basically derived from the password and the **Factor's Polynomial**. In which, the x-value of the **Recovery Factor** is the hashed value of the user's password.

$$
\text{x}_\text{rec} \leftarrow \text{Hash}(\texttt{password}) \mid \text{client}
$$

Then, we can get the y-value of the **Recovery Factor** (i.e the **Recovery Key**) by substituting the **Factor's Polynomial** with the x-value.

$$
\sigma_\text{rec} \leftarrow f_\Phi\left(x = \text{x}_\text{rec}\right) \mid \text{client}
$$

We will have the **Recovery Factor** as a point in the _Cartesian coordinate system_.

$$
\Phi_\text{rec} = \left(\text{x}_\text{rec}, \sigma_\text{rec}\right)
$$

The value $x_\text{rec}$ will be stored in to our **Metadata Storage** for the purpose of combining with the user's password to recreate the **Recovery Factor** when needed. Obviously this doesn't need security because only this x-value alone can't cause any vulnerability to the system.

## Theorem 6 - Multi-key generation

With the same idea to how **Recovery Key** is generated, user can generate as many keys as they want, called **Child Keys** (or child wallets). When generating a new key, the client will generate randomly a new **Private Key**.

$$
\text{x}_\text{priv}' \overset{{\scriptscriptstyle{\text{R}}}}{\leftarrow}\mathbb{G}  \mid  \text{client}
$$

The **Child Key** can be derived by substituting the **Factor's Polynomial** with the x-value.

$$
\sigma_\text{priv}' \leftarrow f_\Phi\left(x = \text{x}_\text{priv}'\right) \mid \text{client}
$$

The values $\text{x}_\text{priv}'$ will be stored in to our **Metadata Storage** for the purpose of combining with the **Factor's Polynomial** to derive all the **Child Keys** $\sigma_\text{priv}'$ when needed.

## Theorem 7 - Private Key derivation theshold

Overall, whenever user logs in, there is only 2/3 **Factors** needed to be provided: **Network Factor**, **Device Factor** and **Recovery Factor** (if **MFA** is turned on).

- Case 1: Sign in via OAuth (**Network Factor**) on the original device (**Device Factor**)
- Case 2: Sign in via OAuth (**Network Factor**) with password (**Recovery Factor**)
- Case 3: Sign on the original device (**Device Factor**) with password (**Recovery Factor**)

In which, case 2 and case 3 are only available when **MFA** is turned on.

Which 2/3 **Factors**, user can reconstruct the **Factor's Polynomial** by using _Lagrange interpolation_. The **Private Key** can be derived by intersecting the polynomial with the y-axis (where $x = 0$).

$$
\sigma_\text{priv} \leftarrow f_\Phi(x = 0) \mid \text{client}
$$

To deal with **Child Keys**, user must make a request to our **Metadata Storage** to all the x-values of the **Child Keys**. Then all the **Child Keys** can be derived by substituting the **Factor's Polynomial** with those x-values.

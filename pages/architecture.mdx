# Architecture

## ARM Token

**ARM Token** (or **Arism Token**) is a Fungible Token for staking, rewarding and fining in operating **Arism Nodes**.

## Arism Network

### Mainnet (Validation Network)

**Mainnet** is the main network for executing algorithms to verify third-party accounts and conduct **Network Key** for users.

**Mainnet** is made up by a set of 5 **Validation Nodes**. 

### Subnet (Backup Network)

**Subnet** is the network that provides **Backup Nodes** when there is a dead, malicious or expired **Validation Node** in **Mainnet**. There is also only **5 Backup Nodes** available at same time. Everytime there is a node leaving the **Mainnet**, a **Backup Node** will be promoted to replace it.

For some security reasons, all **Validation Nodes** will have to recreate their data along with this node. Because **Validation Nodes** cannot know exactly the data is held by the old node, and they cannot share their **Secrets** to reproduce that old node's data to the new node either. This is called **Proactive Secret Sharing (PSS)** algorithm (which will be mentioned later).

## Arism Node

**Arism Node** operator will prepare an available server (or device) with a staked amount of **ARM Token**.

### Validation Node

**Validation Nodes** are the **Arism Nodes** which joining into the **Mainnet**. When a user registers an account, each node will generate 1 **Secret** and 5 **Shares** (by number of nodes) for that account.

While **Secrets** are the private data, **Shares** have 5 times more numbers than **Secrets** because a node will share 1 **Share** for each remaining node on the network. This is called **Distributed Secret Sharing (DSS)** algorithm (which will be mentioned later).

### Backup Node

**Backup Nodes** are the **Arism Nodes** which are in the queue to protect each **Validation Node** in the **Mainnet**.

### Supervised Node

This is part of the **Circularly Protecting Secret Sharing (CPSS)** algorithm, to ensure that when a **Validation Node** dies, it will still be possible to generate **Network Keys** as long as the number of dead Nodes is below a certain threshold or conditions.

One **Validation Node** will supervise the other **Validation Node**. When a node dies, the node that is supervising it will take care of performing the algorithm for it.

However, a node will only be able to supervise JUST ONE other node. All node must monitor another node circularly, because if a node monitors on 2 or more other nodes, it can find or manipulate the **Network Key** (which will be mentioned later).

### Node lifecycle

**Validation Node**'s lifetime is determined based on the staked amount of **ARM Token** and the number of **Backup Nodes** in the queue.

This ensures a degree of decentralization, preventing node operators from colluding with each other to damage the integrity and security of the network.

### Rewards and fines

**Validation Nodes** will receive rewards periodically for their work. **Backup Nodes** will receive a portion of the rewards as well because they still have to work continuously while waiting for a **Voting Event**.

If a **Validation Node** is found to be dead or malicious, it will be fined and removed from the **Arism Network**. It will not be able to withdraw the entire staked amount of **ARM Token** because it will be deducted from a fine amount.

The reward amount will be calculated based on the staked amount and waiting/working time, while the fine amount will be calculated based on the remaining time it still has before the deadline.

### Voting Event

**Validation Nodes** will be randomly selected from **Backup Nodes** (but with priority on the staked amount of **ARM Tokens**), meaning that **Backup Nodes** with the most staked amount of **ARM Tokens** will have a high chance of participating into **Arism Network** as a **Validation Node** when there is an **Validation Node** dies or expires.

Nodes will be managed on a **Smart Contract** and voting will also be executed on the **Smart Contract** as well to ensure the transparency property. This will happen automatically between **Validation Nodes** whenever a node detects (or requests) of a dead or malicious node, such a node is called **Victim Node**.

Of course, a positive vote will be cast if a node finds the **Victim Node** active, a negative vote will be cast if a node finds the **Victim Node** dead or malicious. Absolutely no human intervention.

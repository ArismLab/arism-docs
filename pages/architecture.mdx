## ARM Token

**ARM Token** (or **Arism Token**) is a Fungible Token for staking, rewarding and fining in operating **Arism Nodes**.

## Arism Node

**Arism Node** operator will prepare an available server (or device) with a staked amount of **ARM Token**.

The **Arism Network** is a distributed network linked together by 5 **Validation Nodes**.

### Validation Node

**Validation Nodes** are the **Arism Nodes** which joining into the main network for executing algorithms to verify third-party accounts which users used for registering their accounts.

### Whitelist Node (Backup Node)

**Whitelist Nodes** are the **Arism Nodes** which are in the queue to become **Validation Nodes**.

### Supervised Node

This is part of the **Circularly Protecting Secret Sharing (CPSS)** algorithm, to ensure that when a **Validation Node** dies, it will still be possible to generate **Network Keys** as long as the number of dead Nodes is below a certain threshold or conditions.

One **Validation Node** will supervise the other **Validation Node**. When a node dies, the node that is supervising it will take care of performing the algorithm for it.

However, a node will only be able to supervise JUST ONE other node. All node must monitor another node circularly, because if a node monitors on 2 or more other nodes, it can find or manipulate the **Network Key** (which will be mentioned later).

### Node lifecycle

**Validation Node**'s lifetime is determined based on the staked amount of **ARM Token** and the number of **Whitelist Nodes** in the queue.

This ensures a degree of decentralization, preventing node operators from colluding with each other to damage the integrity and security of the network.

### Rewards and fines

**Validation Nodes** will receive rewards periodically for their work. **Whitelist Nodes** will receive a portion of the rewards as well because they still have to work continuously while waiting for a **Voting Event**.

If a **Validation Node** is found to be dead or malicious, it will be fined and removed from the **Arism Network**. It will not be able to withdraw the entire staked amount of **ARM Token** because it will be deducted from a fine amount.

The reward amount will be calculated based on the staked amount and waiting/working time, while the fine amount will be calculated based on the remaining time it still has before the deadline.

### Voting Event

**Validation Nodes** will be randomly selected from **Whitelist Nodes** (but with priority on the staked amount of **ARM Tokens**), meaning that **Whitelist Nodes** with the most staked amount of **ARM Tokens** will have a high chance of participating into **Arism Network** as a **Validation Node** when there is an **Validation Node** dies or expires.

Nodes will be managed on a **Smart Contract** and voting will also be executed on the **Smart Contract** as well to ensure the transparency property. This will happen automatically between **Validation Nodes** whenever a node detects (or requests) of a dead or malicious node, such a node is called **Victim Node**.

Of course, a positive vote will be cast if a node finds the **Victim Node** active, a negative vote will be cast if a node finds the **Victim Node** dead or malicious. Absolutely no human intervention.

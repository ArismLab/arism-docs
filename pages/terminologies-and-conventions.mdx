# Terminologies & Conventions

## Application side

There are some cryptographic algorithms on the application side:

-   **Lagrange's Interpolation**: An algorithm to reconstruct the **Factor's Polynomial**.
-   **Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)**: An algorithm to create a unique line on the _Cartesian coordinate system_.

We will encounter some terminologies when talking about mechanisms and algorithms on the application side:

-   **Factor**: A point on the _Cartesian coordinate system_ where the x-value is the index and the y-value is the **Factor's Key**. All factors must be on a unique straight line called **Factor's Polynomial**.
-   **Key (Factor's Key)**: A number which behaves like a private key.
-   **Factor's Polynomial**: A first degree polynomial which is a unique straight line on the _Cartesian coordinate system_, the intersection point between it and the y-axis is the user **Private Key**.

## Network side

There are also some cryptographic algorithms on the network side:

-   **Lagrange's Interpolation**: An algorithm to reconstruct the **Share's Polynomial** and the **Master Share's Polynomial**.
-   **Distributed Secret Sharing (DSS)**: An algorithm to generate a **Network Key**.
-   **Proactive Secret Sharing (PSS)**: An algorithm to protect nodes.
-   **Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)**: An algorithm to verify the integrity of the **Private Line**.

We are proud to introduce our new cryptographic algorithms on the network side used in the mechanisms:

-   **Interchangeable Secret Sharing (ISS)**: An algorithm to handle dead nodes.
-   **Recoverable Secret Sharing (RSS)**: An algorithm to recover dead nodes.

We will encounter some terminologies when talking about those mechanisms and algorithms on the network side:

-   **Secret**: In the algorithm, whenever user registers, each **Validation Node** will create a key. **Secret** is a point on the y-axis of the _Cartesian coordinate system_ whose y-value is that key.
-   **Share's Polynomial**: A second degree polynomial which is a unique parabolic line on the _Cartesian coordinate system_, the intersection point between it and the y-axis is the **Secret**'s Key.
-   **Generated Shares**: A re the points whose each x-value corresponds to the sequence number of a **Validation Node** (which are $x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$), and the y-value is the result of the **Share's Polynomial** when substituted by the x-value.
-   **Received Shares**: A re the points which x-values are only one number (the sequence number of a **Validation Node**) and the y-values are the values when substituted that x-value into all the **Share's Polynomials** of the **Validation Nodes**.
-   **Share**: An element of the **Generated Shares** or the **Received Shares**, which is a pair of x-value and y-value.
-   **Master Share**: Sum of the **Received Shares** (sum of all **Share** following an x-value).
-   **Master Share's Polynomial**: A second degree polynomial which is a unique parabolic line on the _Cartesian coordinate system_ formed by the **Master Shares**.
-   **Network Key**: The y-value of the **Master Share's Polynomial** where $x = 0$.

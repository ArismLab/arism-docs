# Conclusions

## Notes

The nodes only communicate with each other when user registers an account. When logging in, there is no need to communicate with other nodes, therefore dead or malicious nodes are only detected when a user registers an account.

_Cartesian coordinate system_ on application side has only straight lines, while on network side has only parabolic lines. Because on application side, there are 3 factors, while on network side, there are 5 nodes.

## Future implementations

-   Integrate **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** and **Verifiable Credential (VC)** into the protocol.
-   Integrate **Account Abstraction (AA)** into the protocol.
-   Multiple private keys support.
-   SDK for developers to integrate the protocol into their applications.
